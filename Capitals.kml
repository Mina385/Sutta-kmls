      <name>Āpaṇa</name>
      <description><![CDATA[<br>A city in the Aṅguttarāpa country, probably its capital. The Buddha once visited the city with 1,250 monks and the whole company was entertained by the Jaṭila Keṇiya (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd6">Vin.i.245ff.</a>). From Āpaṇa the Buddha went on to Kusinārā (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd6">Vin.i.247</a>). In the Saṁyutta Nikāya, (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.50">SN.v.225</a>) Āpaṇa is spoken of as a township of the Aṅgas and the Buddha is mentioned as having stayed there with Sāriputta. <br><br>Several suttas were preached at Āpaṇa, among them the Potaliya Sutta (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn54">MN.i.359ff.</a>), the Laṭukikopama Sutta (to Udāyi) (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn66">MN.i.447ff.</a>), the Sela Sutta (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn92">MN.ii.146ff.</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/snp3.7">Snp.p.102ff.</a>) and the Saddhā or Āpaṇa Sutta (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.50">SN.v.225–227</a>). <br><br>On the occasion of the Buddha’s visit to Āpaṇa, during which he converted Sela and Keṇiya, he seems to have stayed at Āpaṇa for over a week and ordained three hundred monks in the company of Sela (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/snp3.8">Snp.p.112</a>).]]></description>

It was one of the four places of pilgrimage for the Buddhists - the others being Kapilavatthu, Buddhagayā and Kusināra - because it was at, the Migadāya in Isipatana near Bārānasī that the Buddha preached his first sermon to the Pañcavaggiyā (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN.ii.141</a>). <br><br>The Buddha is several times spoken of as staying in Benares, where he preached several sermons (e.g <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.15">AN.i.110f.</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.128">AN.i.279f.</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an6.60">AN.iii.392ff.</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an6.61">AN.iii.399ff.</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn4.4">SN.i.105.</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn55.53">SN.v.406.</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd5">Vin.i.189.</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd6">Vin.i.216f.</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd8">Vin.i.289</a>) and converted many people including Yasa, whose home was in Benares (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd1">Vin.i.15</a>), and his friends Vimala, Subāhu, Punnaji and Gavampati, all members of eminent families (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd1">Vin.i.19</a>). Isipatana (q.v.) became a monastic centre in the Buddha's time and continued so for long after. <br><br>Benares was an important centre of trade and industry. There was direct trade between there and Sāvatthi (DhA.iii.429), the road passing through Bhaddiya (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd5">Vin.i.189</a>), and between there and Takkasilā (DhA.i.123). It was the custom for enthusiastic young men of Benares to go to the university at Takkasilā (e.g. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ja152">Ja.ii.4</a>; DhA.i.250), but there seem to have been educational institutions at Benares also, some of which were older than even those of Takkasilā (KhA.198; see also DhA.iii.445, where Susīma, Sankha's son, goes from Takkasilā to Benares for purposes of study). <br><br>From Verañjā to Benares there seem to have been two routes: one rather circuitous, passing through Soreyya, and the other direct, crossing the Ganges at Payāgatittha. From Benares the road continued to Vesāli (Sp.i.201). On the road from Benares to Rājagaha was Andhakavinda (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/|Vin.i.220]]). There seems to have been friendly intercourse between the chieftains of Benares and the kings of Magadha, as shown by the fact that Bimbisāra sent his own physician, Jīvaka, to attend to the son of the Treasurer of Benares ([[https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd6">Vin.i.275</a>). The distance from Kosambī to Benares was thirty leagues by river (MA.ii.929). <br><br>The extent of the city of Benares, including its suburbs, at the time when it was the capital of an independent kingdom, is often stated (e.g <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ja496">Ja.iv.377</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ja466">Ja.vi.160</a>; MA.ii.608) to have been twelve leagues. The names of several kings are mentioned in the Jātakas, among them being those of Anga, Uggasena, Udaya, Kikī, Dhanañjaya, Mahāsīlava, Vissasena, and Samyama (The SNA. on the <a href="https://suttacentral.net/snp1.3">Khaggavisāna Sutta</a> contains the names of several kings of Benares who renounced the world and became Pacceka Buddhas). <br><br>The name which occurs most frequently, however, is that of Brahmadatta, which seems to have been the dynastic name of the Benares kings. In the Mahāgovinda Sutta, the foundation of Bārānasī is attributed to Mahāgovinda, its first king being Dhatarattha, contemporary of Renu (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn19">DN.ii.235</a>). The Ceylon Chronicles (MT. 127; 129; 130) mention the names of others who reigned in Benares - e.g. Duppasaha and sixty of his descendants; Asoka, son of Samankara, and eighty four thousand of his descendants; also sixteen kings, ancestors of Okkāka. The city itself had been known by different names at different periods; thus, in the time of the Udaya Jātaka it was called Surundhana; in that of the Sutasoma, Sudassana; in that of the Sonananda, Brahmavaddhana; in that of the Khandahāla, Pupphavatī; in that of the Yuvañjaya, Rammanagara (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/ja459">Ja.iv.119f.</a>); and in that of the Sankha, Molinī (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/ja441">Ja.iv.15</a>). It was also called Kāsinagara and Kāsipura (e.g. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ja514">Ja.v.54</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ja543">Ja.vi.165</a>; DhA.i.87), being the capital of Kāsi. The Bhojājāniya Jātaka (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/ja22">Ja.i.178</a>) says that &quot;all the kings around coveted the kingdom of Benares.&quot; In the Brahāchatta Jātaka (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/ja335">Ja.iii.116</a>), the king of Benares is mentioned as having captured the whole of Kosala. At the time of the Buddha, however, Benares had lost its great political importance. Kosala was already the paramount power in India, and several successful invasions of Kāsi by the Kosalans under their kings Vanka, Dabbasena and Kamsa, are referred to. The final conquest would seem to be ascribed to Kamsa because the epithet Bārānasīggha (conqueror of Benares) is an established addition to his name (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/ja413">Ja.ii.403</a>). <br><br>Later, when Ajātasattu succeeded in establishing his sway over Kosala, with the help of the Licchavis, Kāsī, too, was included in his kingdom. Even in the Buddha's time the city of Benares was wealthy and prosperous and was included in the list of great cities suggested by Ananda as suitable places for the Parinibbāna of the Buddha (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN.ii.146</a>). <br><br><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/0lBQklA5uoWjwM0uRghmGXxSov9_QaM_rk2err-OOsxmrZs7__aZiW-NXXxwYvFhPaoqE3Gn71cd5pReR1SYK6qigkaOCMwl" height="auto" max-width="600" /><br><br><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Pzc28Yz0yTI0ZYkL_4LWKScFd-CzWXf0ylN036icp4baazKczgU6KSqDCxSmmHZ1myC36yVNrJRD_bEeq3TzdA" height="auto" max-width="600" /><br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/EuANfmiAY1OQvayGgmdqBVLz7J1XLP8kALYNcoscweO-lcDjH4j15p5TZfQ8T_FhUv0q7hGy2eFwxJfl3Fbwr5O1_lwdvhmwYr2hXGepBHfsyg" height="auto" max-width="600" /><br><br><iframe max-width="600" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qYOUSCDNFvI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<br>A city in India on the river of the same name; it was the capital of Aṅga and was celebrated for its beautiful lake, the Gaggarā-pokkharaṇī. On its banks was a grove of campaka-trees, well known for the fragrance of their marvellous white flowers, and there, in the Buddha’s time, wandering teachers were wont to lodge. The Buddha himself stayed thereon several occasions (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd9">Vin.i.312</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn3.17">SN.i.195</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an7.52">AN.iv.59</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an8.10">AN.iv.168</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an10.81">AN.v.151</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd9">Vin.i.312</a>). Sāriputta (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an7.52">AN.iv.59</a>) and Vaṅgīsa (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn3.17">SN.i.195</a>) are also said to have stayed there. The Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN.ii.147</a>) mentions Campā as one of the six important cities of India, its foundation being ascribed to Mahāgovinda (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn19">DN.ii.235</a>). In the Buddha’s time the people of Campā owed allegiance to Bimbisāra, as king of Māgadha, and Bimbisāra had given a royal fief in Campā to the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn4">DN.i.111</a>). <br><br>The ninth chapter of the Mahā Vagga of the Vinaya Piṭaka (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd9">Vin.i.312ff</a>; see also <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd22">Vin.ii.307</a>) contains several important regulations laid down by the Buddha at Campā regarding the validity and otherwise of formal acts of the Saṅgha. <br><br>The <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn4">Soṇadaṇḍa</a>, the <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn34">Dasuttara</a>, the <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn51">Kandaraka</a> and the <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an8.10">Kāraṇḍava</a> Suttas were preached there.]]></description>

The administration and judicial business of the city and all other matters of importance were discussed and decided in the Santhāgārasālā (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn3">DN.i.91</a>). The Buddha and his company lived in the Nigrodhārāma or the Mahāvana. When the Buddha returned a few years after his enlightenment, he met many of his family, and several of them ordained, including Nanda and Rāhula (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd1">Vin.i.82</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd17">Vin.ii.180</a>). <br><br>The Buddha certainly paid other visits besides these to Kapilavatthu. Various Sākyans went to see him both at the Nigrodhārāma and at the Mahāvana, among them being Mahānāma (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn55.21">SN.v.369f.</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an6.8">AN.iii.284f.</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an8.25">AN.iv.220f.</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an11.7">AN.v.320f.</a>), Nandiya (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn55.47">SN.v.403f.</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn55.40">SN.v.397f.</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an11.13">AN.v.334f.</a>), Vappa (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.195">AN.ii.196</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn14">MN.i.91</a>) and perhaps Sārakāni (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn55.23">SN.v.372</a>). <br><br>During one visit the Buddha was entrusted with the consecration of a new mote-hall, built by the Sākyans; he preached far into the night in the new building, and, when weary, asked Moggallāna to carry on while he slept. On this occasion was preached the Sekha Sutta (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn53">MN.i.353ff.</a>). <br><br>The books record a visit paid by the Brahmā Sahampati to the Buddha in the Mahāvana at Kapilavatthu. The Buddha, worried by the noisy behavior of some monks who had recently been admitted into the Order, was wondering how he could impress on them the nature of their calling. Sahampati visited him and, being thus encouraged, the Buddha returned to Nigrodhārāma and there performed a miracle before the monks; seeing them impressed, he talked to them on the holy life (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.80">SN.iii.91f.</a>). <br><br>A curious incident is related in connection with a visit paid by the Buddha to Kapilavatthu, when he went there after his rounds among the Kosalans. Mahānāma was asked to find a place of lodging for the night; he searched all through the town without success, and at length the Buddha was compelled to spend the night in the hermitage of Bharaṇḍu, the Kālāman (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.126">AN.i.276f</a>). On another occasion we hear of the Buddha convalescing at Kapilavatthu after an illness (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.73">AN.i.219</a>). <br><br>Not all the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu believed in their kinsman’s great powers. We find, for instance, Daṇḍapāṇi meeting the Buddha in the Mahāvana and, leaning on his staff, questioning him as to his tenets and his gospel. We are told that in answer to the Buddha’s explanations, Daṇḍapāṇi shook his head, waggled his tongue, and went away, still leaning on his staff, his brow puckered into three wrinkles. This was the occasion for the preaching of the Madhupiṇḍika Sutta (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn18">MN.i.108f.</a>). <br><br>Others were more convinced and patronised the Order—e.g. Kāla-Khemaka and Ghaṭāya, who built cells for monks in the Nigrodhārāma, as a result of noticing which the Buddha preached the Mahāsuññata Sutta (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn122">MN.iii.109</a>)<br><br>Mahānāma was the Buddha’s most frequent visitor; to him was preached the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha Sutta (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn14">MN.i.91f.</a>). <br><br>The <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn142">Dakkhiṇā-vibhaṅga Sutta</a> was preached as the result of a visit to the Buddha by Mahā-Pajāpatī-Gotamī. Apart from those already mentioned, another Sākyan lady lived in Kapilavatthu, Kāḷigodhā by name, and she was the only kinsman, with the exception of the Buddha’s father and wife, to be specially visited by the Buddha (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn55.39">SN.v.396</a>). <br><br>The inhabitants of Kapilavatthu are called Kāpilavatthavā (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.243">SN.iv.182</a>). <br><br>From Kapilavatthu lay a direct road to Vesālī, (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd20">Vin.ii.253</a>) and through Kapilavatthu passed the road taken by Bāvarī’s disciples from Alaka to Sāvatthī (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/snp5.1">Snp.p.194</a>). <br><br>It was not mentioned by Ānanda among the great cities, in one of which, in his opinion, the Buddha could more fittingly have died than in Kusinārā (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN.ii.146</a>). After the Buddha’s death, a portion of the relics was claimed by the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu, and a shrine to hold them was erected in the city (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN.ii.167</a>). <br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/LvyuA9TbyNUNuG6VE-EWUWSqb9eB-RD0YLQb2Mzr4Skfcpt90Q9PJGCBe01du_fihbijeI2ptQGMApoFKccU5qM1zoaZWAD76z_1dxNSfiqCsQ" height="auto" max-width="600" />]]></description>

In the time of the Buddha its king was Parantapa, and after him reigned his son Udena. Kosambī was evidently a city of great importance at the time of the Buddha for we find Ānanda mentioning it as one of the places suitable for the Buddha’s Parinibbāna (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN.ii.146</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn17">DN.ii.169</a>). It was also the most important halt for traffic coming to Kosala and Māgadha from the south and the west (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd8">Vin.i.277</a>). <br><br>The usual route from Rājagaha to Kosambī was up the river. This was the route taken by Ānanda when he went with five hundred others to inflict the higher punishment on Channa (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd21">Vin.ii.290</a>), though there seems to have been a land route passing through Anupiya and Kosambī to Rājagaha (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd21">Vin.ii.184f.</a>). In the Sutta Nipāta the whole route is given from Mahissati to Rājagaha, passing through Kosambī, the halting-places mentioned being Ujjeni, Gonaddha, Vedisa, Vanasavhya, Kosambī, Sāketa, Sāvatthī, Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, Pāvā, Bhoganagara and Vesāli (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/snp5.1">Snp.1010–1013</a>). <br><br>Near Kosambī, by the river, was Udena’s park, the Udakavana, where Ānanda and Piṇḍola-Bhāradvāja preached to the women of Udena’s palace on two different occasions (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd21">Vin.ii.290f.</a>). The Buddha is mentioned as having once stayed in the Siṁsapāvana in Kosambī (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn56.31">SN.v.437</a>). <br><br>Already in the Buddha’s time there were four establishments of the Order in Kosambī—the Kukkuṭārāma, the Ghositārāma, the Pāvārika-ambavana, and the Badarikārāma. The Buddha visited Kosambī on several occasions, stopping at one or other of these residences, and several discourses delivered during these visits are recorded in the books. <br><br>A great division once arose among the monks in Kosambī. Some monks charged one of their colleagues with having committed an offence, but he refused to acknowledge the charge and, being himself learned in the Vinaya, argued his case and pleaded that the charge be dismissed. The rules were complicated; on the one hand, the monk had broken a rule and was treated as an offender, but on the other, he should not have been so treated if he could not see that he had done wrong. The monk was eventually excommunicated, and this brought about a great dissension. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he admonished the partisans of both sides and urged them to give up their differences, but they paid no heed, and even blows were exchanged. The people of Kosambī, becoming angry at the monks’ behaviour, the quarrel grew apace. The Buddha once more counselled concord, relating to the monks the story of King Dīghiti of Kosala, but his efforts at reconciliation were of no avail, one of the monks actually asking him to leave them to settle their differences without his interference. In disgust the Buddha left Kosambī and, journeying through Bālakaloṇakāragāma and the Pācīnavaṁsadāya, retired alone to keep retreat in the Pārileyyaka forest. In the meantime the monks of both parties repented, partly owing to the pressure exerted by their lay followers in Kosambī, and, coming to the Buddha at Sāvatthī, they asked his pardon and settled their dispute (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd10">Vin.i.337–357</a> also see <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn48">MN.i.320</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn128">MN.iii.152</a>). The story of the Buddha going into the forest is given in the Udāna (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/ud4.5">Ud.iv.5</a>) and in the Saṁyutta, (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.81">SN.iii.94</a>) but the reason given in these texts is that he found Kosambī uncomfortable owing to the vast number of monks, lay people and heretics. <br><br>During the time of the Vajjian heresy, when the Vajjian monks of Vesāli wished to excommunicate Yasa Kākandakaputta, he went by air to Kosambī, and from there sent messengers to the orthodox monks in the different centres (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd22">Vin.ii.298</a>). <br><br>It was at Kosambī that the Buddha promulgated a rule forbidding the use of intoxicants by monks (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd22">Vin.ii.307</a>). <br><br>Kosambī is mentioned in the Saṁyutta Nikāya (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.241">SN.iv.179</a>) as being on the Ganges, but here as elsewhere this simply means on a great river, in this case the Yamuna.]]></description>

At that time it was a small city, "a branch-township with wattle-and-daub houses in the midst of the jungle” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn17">DN.ii.169</a>) and Ānanda was, at first, disappointed that the Buddha should have chosen it for his Parinibbāna. But the Buddha pointed out to him that in ancient times it had been Kusāvatī, the royal city of Mahā-Sudassana (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN.ii.146ff.</a>). The Buddha likened it to Āḷakamandā, the capital city of the gods which is prosperous, successful, populous, full of people, with much food. Kusinārā was twelve leagues in length and twelve in breadth. It was then at the head of eighty-four towns (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn14.7">SN.iii.144</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn17">DN.ii.170f.</a>). <br><br>Between Kusinārā and Pāvā lay the stream of Kakuttha on the banks of which was the Ambavana; beyond that was the Hiraññavatī river. <br><br>After the Buddha’s death his body was carried into the city by the northern gate and out of the city by the eastern gate; to the east of the city was Makuṭabandhana, the shrine of the Mallas, and there the body was cremated. For seven days those assembled at the ceremony held a festival in honour of the relics (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN.ii.160f.</a>). <br><br>As the scene of his death, Kusinārā became one of the four holy places declared by the Buddha to be fit places of pilgrimage for the pious, the other three being Kapilavatthu, Buddhagayā and Isipatana (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN.ii.140</a>). Mention is made of other visits paid to Kusinārā by the Buddha. Once he went there from Āpaṇa and having spent some time at Kusinārā, proceeded to Ātumā. The Mallas of Kusinārā were always great admirers of the Buddha, even though not all of them were his followers, and on the occasion of this visit they decided that any inhabitant of Kusinārā who failed to go and meet the Buddha and escort him to the city, would be fined five hundred. It was on this occasion that Rojā the Mallan was converted and gave to the Buddha and the monks a supply of green vegetables and pastries (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd6">Vin.i.247f.</a>). During some of these visits the Buddha stayed in a wood called Baliharana, and there he preached two of the Kusinārā Suttas (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.123">AN.i.274f</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an10.44">AN.v.79f</a>) and the “Kinti” Sutta (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn103">MN.ii.238f.</a>). A third Kusinārā Sutta he preached while staying at Upavattana (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.76">AN.ii.79</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ud4.2">Ud.iv.2</a>). <br><br>The people of Kusinārā are called Kosinārakā (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN.ii.167</a>). <br><br><iframe max-width="600" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2kMJxs3LM7U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/A1Z_pShtbLxL15FO_Iaw1DFaVFEE42TRGvEkmNzwxeZdvsX-kOhr4P1_MVmBCvhPsUF-0QXV1XOGy5rcPr_mAgE" height="auto" max-width="600" /><br><br><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Qe_v4ny1bPSO_0kC07kO7FhA-w_X--YH8YbXu5rQj5nT0lKa0oYDYkfQrQZo1ehnIThkmIfnrmf8tOpu4y0yROk" height="auto" max-width="600" />]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<br>The capital of Surasena, situated on the Yamunā. Its king, soon after the death of Bimbisāra, was Avantiputta, (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn84">MN.ii.83</a>) who, judging by his name, was probably related to the royal family of Ujjeni. Madhurā was visited by the Buddha (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.53">AN.ii.57</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an5.220">AN.iii.256</a>), but there is no record of his having stayed there. In fact, the <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn84">Madhura Sutta</a> states that he viewed the city with distinct disfavour. But Mahā Kaccāna evidently liked it, for he stayed there in the Gundāvana, and was visited there by the king of the city, Avantiputta (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn84">MN.ii.83</a>), and the brahmin Kandarāyana (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.38">AN.i.67</a>). Already in the Buddha’s time there were, in and around Madhurā, those who accepted his teachings, for the Aṅguttara Nikāya (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.53">AN.ii.57</a>) mentions that once when he was journeying from Madhurā to Verañja and stopped under a tree by the wayside, a large number of householders, both men and women, came and worshipped him.]]></description>

It is said (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn116">MN.iii.68</a>) that these hills, with the exception of Isigili, were once known by other names e.g. Vaṅkaka for Vepulla (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn8.7">SN.ii.191</a>). The Saṁyutta (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn10.1">SN.i.206</a>) mentions another peak near Rājagaha—Indakūta. <br><br>Rājagaha was closely associated with the Buddha’s work. He visited it soon after the Renunciation. Bimbisāra saw him begging in the street, and questioned him as to his purpose (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/snp3.4">Snp.472–491</a>). During the first year after the Enlightenment the Buddha went to Rājagaha from Gayā, after the conversion of the Tebhātika Jatilas. Bimbisāra and his subjects gave the Buddha a great welcome, and the king entertained him and a large following of monks in the palace. It is said that on the day of the Buddha’s entry into the royal quarters, Sakka led the procession, in the guise of a young man, singing songs of praise of the Buddha (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd1">Vin.i.35ff.</a>). Large numbers of householders joined the Order, and people blamed the Buddha for breaking up their families. But their censure lasted for only seven days. Among those ordained were the Sattarasavaggiyā with Upāli at their head. <br><br>The Buddha spent his first vassa in Rājagaha and remained there during the winter and the following summer. The people grew tired of seeing the monks everywhere, and, on coming to know of their displeasure, the Buddha went first to Dakkhiṇāgiri and then to Kapilavatthu (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd1">Vin.i.77ff.</a>). <br><br>Later the Buddha made Sāvatthī his headquarters, though he seems frequently to have visited and stayed at Rājagaha. It thus became the scene of several important suttas—e.g. the <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn32">Āṭānāṭiya</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn25">Udumbarika</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.17">Kassapasīhanāda</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn55">Jīvaka</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn77">Mahāsakuladāyī</a>, and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn21">Sakkapañha</a>. <br><br>Many of the Vinaya rules were enacted at Rājagaha. Just before his death, the Buddha paid a last visit there. At that time, Ajātasattu was contemplating an attack on the Vajjians, and sent his minister, Vassakāra, to the Buddha at Gijjhakūṭa, to find out what his chances of success were (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN.ii.72</a>). <br><br>After the Buddha’s death, Rājagaha was chosen by the monks, with Mahā Kassapa at their head, as the meeting place of the First Convocation. This took place at the Sattapaṇṇiguhā, and Ajātasattu extended to the undertaking his whole hearted patronage (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd21">Vin.ii.285</a>). The king also erected at Rājagaha a cairn over the relics of the Buddha, which he had obtained as his share (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN.ii.166</a>). <br><br>Rājagaha was one of the six chief cities of the Buddha’s time, and as such, various important trade routes passed through it. The others cities were Campā, Sāvatthī, Sāketa, Kosambī and Benares (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN.ii.147</a>). <br><br>The Parāyana Vagga (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/snp5.1">Snp.1011–1013</a>) mentions a long and circuitous route, taken by Bāvarī’s disciples in going from Patiṭṭhāna to Rājagaha, passing through Māhissati, Ujjeni, Gonaddha, Vedisa. Vanasavhaya, Kosambī, Sāketa, Sāvatthī, Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, on to Rājagaha, by way of the usual places. The Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN.ii.72ff.</a>) gives a list of the places at which the Buddha stopped during his last journey along that road—Ambalaṭṭhikā, Nāḷandā, Pāṭaligāma, Koṭigāma, Nādikā, Vesāli, Bhaṇḍagāma, Hatthigāma, Ambagāma, Jambugāma, Bhoganagara, Pāvā, and the Kakuttha River, beyond which lay the Mango grove and the Sāla grove of the Mallas. <br><br>The books mention various places besides Veḷuvana, with its Kalandaka-nivāpa vihāra in and around Rājagaha—e.g. Sītavana, Jīvaka’s Ambavana, Pipphaliguhā, Udumbarikārāma, Moranivāpa with its Paribbājakārāma, Tapodārāma, Indasālaguhā in Vediyagiri, Sattapaṇṇiguhā, Latthivana, Maddakucchi, Supatiṭṭhacetiya, Pāsānakacetiya, Sappasoṇḍikapabbhāra and the pond Sumāgadhā. <br><br>The city gates were closed every evening, and after that it was impossible to enter the city (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-bu-vb-pc56">Vin.iv.116f.</a>). <br><br>Ajātasattu was afraid of invasion by the Licchavis, and Vassakāra is mentioned as having strengthened its fortifications. To the north east of the city was the brahmin village of Ambasaṇḍā (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn21">DN.ii.263</a>); other villages are mentioned in the neighborhood, such as Kīṭāgiri, Upatissagāma, Kolitagāma, Andhakavinda, Sakkhara and Codanāvatthu. <br><br><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/wqYA5u9RAjC8Dpqswu8rKUB-7bEvJMxQ0CUaa71_lDlWJp6cITzNndyGIW5GU1aMXZF5NEtLfh5hzJRUVz9JvgTfO3Khub3KZiHmVVIkpFJTRYEcrAo" height="auto" max-width="600" /><br><br><iframe max-width="600" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qYOUSCDNFvI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/MuFE13oS-jUCUJbhl8OYu7ZQH2XWKdi0VLd2C1pz1mwsDrLSC75LwVYuUvb5eNqgc5ZG2nBP1e6RALkvftyfemYzPQ" height="auto" max-width="600" /><br><br><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/6rLSdqihELMeAznc8kkpnVrtd7sbEdHVAA2_JJn3yF32i-rhUBFRky10A0vchE88A0KbygYukk4ObknKAxzqeXxFaqP7YXKHUjLRysDdkv8cG1ollyBfTAjo1A" height="auto" max-width="600" /><br><br><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/UvjLSj6BIj7UIGnIBzJu8sSBVBLZoGxm8yAGPq2NHxvL0KC5VR5dZ4mQwq8mTEPVgSNPFRKB2iNsqT13Vjm8EY4" height="auto" max-width="600" /><br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/UmjbrtmOe-EpPQOHbJwI54kueC1EOjv3vItFkWtIhM87itf2u26_SF7gazTGVJhLbyt9052aj7URRrAsMPtiSgI" height="auto" max-width="600" /><br><br><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/S-qLFAYrMEa_YmIgqZhd8Tk6r6dEgg8S8W25XWaYgEz9z3gt3948eXxz6rwwDtEEE7nO9yneXg3VIhcMso2OjhA" height="auto" max-width="600" /><br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Nghk78lJZX3DMpdoa11b_PiBinkze9UxTQ-iNCIIODASn1tnXgHFBTaSUu5x3LWZ1CPGU3rJ5j093zlLSqsdrVw" height="auto" max-width="600" /><br><br><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/1pHUh_GpK6GBGfuEsTI47WtwFXR7RJTHNN0F8ZY8prGpAypAXtNvxZFWv83W481dAwJs59ql3YElSZvbCCwqOybBgweKXRD14OAhK-YrZKy40A" height="auto" max-width="600" />]]></description>

It was six leagues from Sāketa (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd7">Vin.i.253</a>). It was on the banks of the Aciravatī (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd5">Vin.i.191</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd8">Vin.i.293</a>). The road from Rājagaha to Sāvatthī passed through Vesāli (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd16">Vin.ii.159f.</a>), and the Pārāyanavagga (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/snp5.1">Snp.1011–1013</a>) gives the resting places between the two cities Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, Pāvā and Bhoganagara. Further on, there was a road running southwards from Sāvatthī through Sāketa to Kosambī. Near the city was the Andhavana. Between Sāketa and Sāvatthī was Toraṇavatthu (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn44.1">SN.iv.374</a>). <br><br>The Buddha passed the greater part of his monastic life in Sāvatthī, and the vast bulk of all Suttas are set there. <br><br>His first visit there was at the invitation of Anāthapiṇḍika. The chief patrons of the Buddha in Sāvatthī were Anāthapiṇḍika, Visākhā, Suppavāsā and Pasenadi. <br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Duj_e9Y5f_35BHpItcO2Uterko6chkPEfyHhdoYwokMq1W-im0rmr_qC7mYk_NMnaTJykUd1M1mP_JZxxRcKdfQGYv2prqJYhAYVxOJOwz-NLA" height="auto" max-width="600" /><br><br><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/NT51tJAcGl7Z5YMz3InRC7TKM635ZZJXSGj38rtjejw5_UKyCfq6MStt3UPJKEm2W_Rdh32tyTVIMS2-DD-sRDhrXVpq3LP_vNUo0OJjgdwCtA" height="auto" max-width="600" />]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<br>The capital of Avanti. In the Buddha’s time, Caṇḍapajjota (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd8">Vin.i.276</a>) was king of Ujjenī and there was friendly intercourse between that city and Māgadha, whose king was Seniya Bimbisāra. After Bimbisāra’s death, however, Pajjota seems to have contemplated a war against Ajātasathu (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn108">MN.iii.7</a>). <br><br>The road taken by Bāvarī’s disciples ran through Ujjenī (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/snp5.1">Snp.1011</a>). <br><br>Ujjenī was also the birthplace of Isidāsī (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/thig15.1">Thig.405</a>). <br><br>We find Māhissatī mentioned just before Ujjenī among the places passed by Bāvarī’s pupils on their way to Sāvatthī (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/snp5.1">Snp.1011</a>)]]></description>

It is not possible to know how many visits were paid by the Buddha to Vesāli, but the books would lead us to infer that they were several. Various Vinaya rules are mentioned as having been laid down at Vesāli (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd6">Vin.i.238</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd8">Vin.i.287f.</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd15">Vin.ii.118</a>; <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd15">Vin.ii.119–127</a>). <br><br>It was during a stay in Vesāli, whither he had gone from Kapilavatthu, that Mahā Pajāpatī Gotamī followed the Buddha with five hundred other Sākyan women, and, with the help of Ānanda’s intervention, obtained permission for women to enter the Order (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd20">Vin.ii.253ff.</a>). <br><br>The books describe (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN.ii.95ff.</a>) at some length the Buddha’s last visit to Vesāli on his way to Kusinārā. On the last day of this visit, after his meal, he went with Ānanda to Cāpāla cetiya for his siesta, and, in the course of their conversation, he spoke to Ānanda of the beauties of Vesāli: of the Udena cetiya, the Gotamaka cetiya, the Sattambaka cetiya, the Bahuputta cetiya, and the Sārandada cetiya. Other monasteries are also mentioned, in or near Vesāli e.g. Pātikārāma, Vālikārāma. <br><br>The Buddha generally stayed at the Kūṭāgārasālā during his visits to Vesāli, but it appears that he sometimes lived at these different shrines (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN.ii.118</a>). During his last visit to the Cāpāla cetiya he decided to die within three months, and informed Māra and, later, Ānanda, of his decision. The next day he left Vesāli for Bhaṇḍagāma, after taking one last look at the city, “turning his whole body round, like an elephant” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN.ii.122</a>). The rainy season which preceded this, the Buddha spent at Beluvagāma, a suburb of Vesāli, while the monks stayed in and around Vesāli. On the day before he entered into the vassa, Ambapāli invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal, at the conclusion of which she gave her Ambavana for the use of the Order (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN.ii.98</a>). <br><br>Among eminent followers of the Buddha who lived in Vesāli, special mention is made of Ugga, Piṅgiyāni, Kāraṇapālī, Sīha, Vāseṭṭha (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an8.44">AN.iv.258</a>) and the various Licchavis. <br><br>Vesāli was a stronghold of the Nigaṇṭhas. The Buddha’s presence in Vesāli was a source of discomfort to the Nigaṇṭhas, and we find mention of various devices resorted to by them to prevent their followers from coming under the influence of the Buddha. <br><br>At the time of the Buddha, Vesāli was a very large city, rich and prosperous, crowded with people and with abundant food. Its courtesan, Ambapālī, was famous for her beauty, and helped in large measure in making the city prosperous (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pi-tv-kd8">Vin.i.268</a>)<br><br>Outside the town was the Mahāvana, a large, natural forest. Near by were other forests, such as Gosiṅgalasāla (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an10.71">AN.v.134</a>). <br><br>Among important suttas preached at Vesāli are the <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn6">Mahāli</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn12">Mahāsīhanāda</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn35">Cūḷa Saccaka</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn36">Mahā Saccaka</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn13">Tevijja</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn71">Vacchagotta</a>, and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn105">Sunakkhatta</a>. <br><br>One hundred years after the Buddha’s death Vesāli was again the scene of interest for Buddhists, on account of the “Ten Points” raised by the Vajjiputtaka, and the second Council held in connection with this dispute at the Vālikārāma. <br><br>There were Nāgas living in Vesāli; these were called Vesālā (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn20">DN.ii.258</a>). <br><br><iframe max-width="600" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qYOUSCDNFvI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>]]></description>
